## Design Philosophy

Lower is symbols

Raise is numbers and navigation

Adjust/Cfg is mostly config (reset, make, rgb), media controls
(volume and play/pause, fwd, rewind) and also has some navigation like
word navigation, page up/down, jump cursor to start/end of the line, scroll to
top/bottom (macOS)
