## Design Philosophy

Lower is symbols

Raise is numbers and navigation including tab and application switching

Adjust/Cfg is mostly config (reset, make, rgb), media controls
(volume and play/pause, fwd, rewind) and also changes some navigation layer
functions word navigation, page up/down, jump cursor to start/end of the line,
scroll to top/bottom (macOS) and window switching

Num is a toggable layer with a num pad and mouse keys
