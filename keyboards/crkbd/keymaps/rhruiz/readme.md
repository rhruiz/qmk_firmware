## Design Philosophy

Base is QWERTY or Colemak mod-D (mod DH applyed only on the left side)

Lower is symbols and a few progamming macros.

Raise is numbers and navigation including tab and application switching.

Adjust/Cfg is mostly config (reset, make, rgb), media controls
(volume and play/pause, fwd, rewind) and also changes some navigation layer
functions word navigation, page up/down, jump cursor to start/end of the line,
scroll to top/bottom and window switching. All those navigation keys can be
switched between macOS and Linux/Windows shortcuts.

Num is a toggable layer with a num pad and mouse keys.

There is a one shot F keys layer.

Game layer is QWERTY without home row mods, a few different mods and  that can
trigger a Game lower layer with numbers, 5 F keys and shitded mods.
